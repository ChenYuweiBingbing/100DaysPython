# Binary Search Tree (BST)

More details in:

Yesterday(day 03) we mentioned BST. Today, let's go deeper.

Time Complexity:

| Time Complexity    | access    | search    | insert    | delete    |
| :------            | :-----    | :-----    | :-----    | :-----    |
| Average            | Θ(log(n)) | Θ(log(n)) | Θ(log(n)) | Θ(log(n)) |
| Worst              | O(n)      | O(n)      | O(n)      | O(n)      |

1. How to delete a node of BST?
2. How to access the next larger node (aka. the successor node)?

I write the code of main function in TreeNode class, different from code in *day03* which in BinarySearchTree class.
Both are acceptable.
